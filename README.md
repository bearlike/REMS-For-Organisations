> [!NOTE]
> Prior to [version 1.1.5](https://github.com/bearlike/REMS-For-Organisations/tree/release/v1.1.5?tab=readme-ov-file), this project was developed in PHP and has since been fully migrated to Python.

## Overview

REMS began as a fun PHP project in college and has since been completely migrated to Python with Flask. It automates certificate generation, form creation, bulk mailing and more. Over 1500 participants across 20+ events have used it, and you can easily adapt it for your own organization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or newer
- A MySQL-compatible database (tested with MariaDB 10.7)
- `pip` for installing dependencies
- Clone this repository.

> [!WARNING]
> A default user with the username `admin` and password `admin` will be created during initialization. Please change these credentials after project setup and deploying to production.

### Deploy with Docker (Recommended)

- Install Docker and Docker Compose.
- Adjust credentials in [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) if needed.
- Launch with:

```bash
# Build the Docker image, if not already built:
# docker-compose build

docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual Installation

1. Install Python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt` or using Poetry: `poetry install`.
2. Import the sample database from [`docs/files/Sample_REMS_Database.sql`](docs/files/Sample_REMS_Database.sql).
3. Export `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_USER` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` or update `src/config/docker_secrets.py`.
4. Start the app with `flask --app src.app run`.


## Features and Screenshots

Tested on Python 3.11 with MariaDB 10.7

### Certificate Generation and Distribution System (CGDS)

Automatically generate certificates from a template and a CSV file. The certificates are then available for download.

### Database Management

Browse, insert, update and delete records across all databases through a simple interface.

### Form Generation
