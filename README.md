# Introduction

Looking to streamline your organization's event planning process? REMS can help you! Originally created for our college chapter, we've automated the tedious task of creating forms, certificates, and advertising via mail for our 20+ events with 1500+ participants. Now, any organization, club, or institution can easily fork our project and customize it to fit their unique needs. Join the thousands who have already benefited from our service and give it a try today!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run the software:

- Python 3.11+
- A **MySQL** compatible database server (tested on MariaDB 10.7)
- `pip` for installing the Python dependencies

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Import the sample database dump from [docs/files/Sample_REMS_Database.sql](docs/files/Sample_REMS_Database.sql).
4. Export the environment variables `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_USER` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD` or update `src/config/docker_secrets.py` with your credentials.
5. Run the application with `flask --app src.app run`.

### Running REMS with Docker

- Ensure Docker and docker-compose are installed.
- Adjust any credentials in `docker-compose.yml` as needed.
- Start the stack with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Certificate Generation and Distribution System (CGDS)

A two-ended system (Both for **admin** and **public**) that'll automatically  generate certificates and make them available for distribution. The admin will have to upload a **Certificate Template** and a **CSV file** with Participant Names, Position Awarded, and Event Name. The generated certificates would be later automatically made for distribution.

| CDS Public (Collection)                                  | CDS Admin (Generation)                                   | Generated Certificates                                   |

### Database Management

This is an interface for the databases that are used. The administrator can update, insert and delete values from any table of the databases without having to risk cluttering with the structure or format. The interface is made as generic possible to support future development and extensions.

| Database Manager                                         | Modify Tuples                                            | If Error Occurs                                          |

### Form Generation

This tool is used to generate forms for events. Initially, the specifications of the event must be selected and a form is generated with the designated fields and a **table is automatically created in `forms-db`**. The form also has **built-in validation** for all the fields (emails, URLs, etc) and **Markdown support** for event descriptions. Once the form is sent out, the entered values are updated in the database.

| Form Generator                                           | Sample Generated Form                                    |

### Bulk Mailer

The mailer can send automatically send emails to a specific mailing list. It supports HTML emails and comes with a pre-designed template. The parameters for the pre-defined template can be modified for the specifications of the organization.  There is also a feature to create mailing lists to use with these mailers. A CSV of the emails and names has to be uploaded ana a mailing list is created.

### Link Shortener

A link shortener that uses the `short.io` API to render shortened links for distribution. It can make shortened link either with a custom slug or can automatically generate slugs for links.

Perhaps our most desired feature, it gives an option to toggle the page between dark mode and light mode. Saves your eyes in the night :eyes:
