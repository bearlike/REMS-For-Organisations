# Migration Tracker

This file tracks the migration of PHP files to the Python + Jinja2 stack. When migrating a PHP file, create a corresponding Python implementation using SQLAlchemy for database operations. Update the status of each file to **Completed** once the migration is done. If a file has not been migrated yet, keep the status as **Incomplete**.
